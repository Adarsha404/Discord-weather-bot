# Discord-weather-bot
The code represents a Discord weather bot that provides weather information when prompted with the command (!weather {location}).
To utilize the code, you need to initially install the 'discord' and 'requests' modules. Next, access the Discord developer tools and create a new application, followed by generating a bot with appropriate text and read/write permissions.
 Open the bot URL in your browser and invite the bot to your Discord group. Copy the bot token into the code.
 Additionally, obtain your weather API and insert it into the code. Once these steps are completed, the code will function as intended.
